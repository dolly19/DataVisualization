Wine Reviews

An interactive visualization based on a dataset of 130k wine reviews. The data is collected from the Kaggle website posted by Zach Thoutt, which contained roughly 130k wine reviews scraped from Wine Enthusiast magazine. The dataset includes the wine price, where it originates from, a written description from a sommelier, and an 80â€“100 point rating. This dataset offers some great opportunities for sentiment analysis and other text-related predictive models.
